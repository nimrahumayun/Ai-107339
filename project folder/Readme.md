### KNN ###
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. in knn we have used 3 as nearest neighbor to better satisfy our need.

### SVM ###
Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm can be used for both classification or regression challenges.

### Logistic Regression ###
Logistic Regression algorithm is used to performs a regression task.

### Best score ###

We got the best score from the first of features we used in which we generated artificial features and model was linear regression

### First Set of Features ###

we used existing features and generate arifical features from it for training classification the cross-validation gave following outputs

### Second Set of Features ###
we used the same set of features as in the assignment in the first time around the cross-validation gave following outputs

### Third Set of Features ###
we used the same set of features as in the assignment and then we performed feature scaling using sklearn StandardScaler the cross-validation gave following outputs
